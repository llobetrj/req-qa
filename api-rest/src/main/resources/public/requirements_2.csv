The scheduler shall give tasks priority values according to their rate - the higher the rate, the higher the priority.
All tasks in rate groups and their corresponding schedules for all vehicle modes will be setup at system initialization.
If the broadcast option is used, each virtual group should open the pipe and read from it to avoid flow control problems.
When a majority, but not a unanimity, of FCP members are observed with packets in their output buffers, a time-out shall (3.2.2.6.7) be initiated.
